# Online Food Ordering System Based on Spring and Hibernate

•	Implemented RESTful APIs via Spring MVC including registration and login, searching and viewing foods and restaurants, ordering and checkout. Deployed to Amazon EC2.

•	Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the MySQL database (menu, restaurants etc.).

•	Built the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to enable users browse menu, create shopping carts and place orders.

•	Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.

•	Realized the backend with the Spring framework core technologies to loosely organize all the components.
